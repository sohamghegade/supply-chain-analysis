# supply-chain-analysis
This repository contains my complete Supply Chain Analytics project completed during my Data Analyst Internship at AI Variant.
It highlights end-to-end data analysis using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau to uncover inefficiencies, evaluate supplier performance, and build dashboards for monitoring the supply chain process.

Project Structure
1. Excel – Data Understanding & Preparation

Raw supply chain dataset

Data cleaning workflow (handling missing values, standardizing fields, formatting tables)

Exploratory Data Analysis (demand trends, lead times, product movement)

Pivot tables, charts, and summary insights

🔹 2. SQL – Analytical Insights

20+ SQL queries for detailed analysis

Joins, aggregations, ranking, and window functions

KPIs: inventory turnover, supplier performance, order accuracy, delays

Module-wise tasks with query outputs

🔹 3. Power BI – Interactive Dashboard

Power BI dashboard file

Data model design and relationship mapping

DAX measures for KPIs and time-based calculations

Visual summaries on demand patterns, delay trends, supplier metrics

🔹 4. Tableau – Visual Analytics

Tableau packaged workbook

Final dashboard views

Custom calculations and analytical views (lead time, order cycles, fulfillment patterns)

 Tools Used


Excel – Cleaning, EDA, Pivot Analysis


SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) – Insight Generation, KPI Reporting


Power BI – Data Modeling, DAX, KPI Dashboards


Tableau – Interactive Visualizations, Advanced Calculations



 Project Objective
To perform comprehensive analysis of supply chain operations by:


Understanding the flow of products and supplier dynamics


Cleaning and structuring raw supply chain data


Extracting insights using SQL


Designing dashboards for real-time performance tracking


Creating actionable recommendations for process improvement



 Key Highlights


Conducted structured data preprocessing and validation


Executed advanced SQL analytics across supplier, inventory, and order datasets


Developed interactive dashboards in both Power BI and Tableau


Identified delays, bottlenecks, and improvement opportunities


Demonstrated complete analytics workflow from raw data to insights



 Why This Project Matters
This Supply Chain Analytics project reflects my ability to work with operational datasets, evaluate performance indicators, and build dashboards that support decision-making. It showcases my capability to apply analytical thinking and multi-tool proficiency to solve practical business challenges.
